This is a very simple random image generator application that uses a third-party API to fetch random images. At every moment, random images of different sizes are shown on the DOM via the API. Each time the "Read More" button is clicked, generate a new image . This provides users with a constantly changing visual experience, showcasing a variety of images and adding an element of surprise and discovery to the application.
